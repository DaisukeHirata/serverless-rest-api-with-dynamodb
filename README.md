# Serverless REST API

This demonstrates how to setup a [RESTful Web Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Applied_to_web_services) allowing you to create, list, get, update and delete ShareImages meta info. DynamoDB is used to store the data. This is just an example and of course you could use any data storage as a backend.

This sample is based on [this sample](https://github.com/serverless/examples/tree/master/aws-node-rest-api-with-dynamodb)
